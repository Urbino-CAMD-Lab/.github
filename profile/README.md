# Welcome to the CAMD Lab!
The Computer-assisted Molecular Design (CAMD) Lab is part of the Department of Biomolecular Sciences at the __University of Urbino__ Carlo Bo.

We specialize in __molecular modeling__ and __computational drug discovery__.   

Our team is dedicated to developing innovative methodologies that accelerate drug discovery. We have deep expertise in computational chemistry, particularly in creating tools and techniques that make drug design faster and more precise.

The lab was founded and is currently headed by Giovanni Bottegoni, a computational medicinal chemist with an academic and industrial background. To know more about the group and our research, visit our website at [camd.uniurb.it](https://camd.uniurb.it/)
