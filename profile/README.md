# Welcome to the CAMD Lab
The Computer-assisted Molecular Design (CAMD) Lab is part of the Department of Biomolecular Sciences at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo.

We specialize in molecular modeling and computational drug discovery.   

Our team is dedicated to developing innovative methodologies that accelerate drug discovery. We have deep expertise in computational chemistry, particularly in creating tools and techniques that make drug design faster and more precise.

The lab was founded and is currently headed by Giovanni Bottegoni, a computational medicinal chemist with an academic and industrial background.
